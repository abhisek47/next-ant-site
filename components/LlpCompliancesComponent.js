                    Annual compliances for limited liability partnership
                  </Title>
                  <Paragraph strong>
                    A Limited Liability Partnership enjoys a separate status.
                    Thus, an organization needs to maintain its active status by
                    regularly filing with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
                    (MCA). Annual compliance filing is mandatory for any LLP,
                    whether having a business or not. Annual compliance for LLP
                    requires filing two separate forms. One of which is for
                    Annual Return, whereas another one is for Statement of
                    Accounts and Solvency.
                  </Paragraph>
                  <Paragraph strong>
                    The forms are filed for reporting the activities and
                    financial data for each financial year in the upcoming year.
                    The failure to fulfill LLP Annual Compliance requirements
                    levies an additional fee of â‚¹ 100 each day of a delay till
                    the actual date of filing. Hence, apart from the mandate,
                    the heavy penalty compels the Designated Partners to fulfill
                    the requirements.
